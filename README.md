# AB-Test-Facebook

# Business Problem
- Facebook recently introduced a new type of bidding, "average bidding", as an alternative to the existing type of bidding called "maximumbidding". 
- One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and wants to run an A/B test to see if averagebidding brings more conversions than maximumbidding.

# Data Story

- Maximum Bidding was applied to the control group and AverageBidding was applied to the test group.
